**TL;DR**: If you have more workers per machine than machines total, Viscacha may be much more efficient than Memcache. Of course YMMV.

Reads and writes to Viscacha will always be between 10 and **50 times faster than to a Memcache server**.

### Use cases

If you run an app on few machines with multiple workers, typical for feldging apps hosted on Heroku, you're may already be using Memcache to store fragments and the odd flag.

The roundtrip to Memcache servers is expensive (3-5ms per `fetch` is typical), so it's not much of an advantage over in-memory caching… except you can't afford the memory for a large cache on each worker.

Viscacha lets you run an in-process cache that's almost as fast as `ActiveSupport::MemoryStore`, but

- shared between processes on the same machine (or dyno)
- persistent (to the extent that the machine keeps files—Heroku will of course not persist your cache across dyno restarts)
- memory mapped (so it doesn't hijack your low dyno resources)

It's not shared across *machines* like Memcache is (it's not a server) but for high worker-per-machine to machine ratio (e.g. 2:2, or 4 workers spread over 2 machines), it's really worth it.

For bigger apps running on few machines (e.g. 12:4 on Amazon's 8-core instances), it's even more efficient, as your cache will effectively be shared by more workers.

### How it works

Viscacha is a fairly thin wrapper around [localmemcache](http://localmemcache.rubyforge.org).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'viscacha'

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    
If using Rails, in `config/application.rb`:

    config.cache_store = :viscacha
    
Done!


## Usage

Use as you'd usually use any other ActiveSupport [cache backend](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveSupport/Cache/Store), the
excellent [Dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) for instance.

**CAVEAT**: by design, calling `#clear` on a Viscacha cache (e.g. through `Rails.cache.clear`), or any other write operation (`#delete`, `#write`), will not propagate to workers on other machines!

Be careful to only use `#fetch`, and design accordingly: no cache sweepers, rely on timestamps, IDs, and expiry instead.


## Benchmarks

Bear in mind those are microbenchmarks, so your mileage may vary. The bottom
line is that on a single machine, Viscacha will be considerably faster than Memcache in pretty much all situations.

This compares how 5 cache stores react to repeated `#fetch` calls, using modern hardware and networking (2.2GHz Core i7, running Darwin).

- Viscacha
- `ActiveSupport::MemMacheStore` (using the `memcache-client`)
- `ActiveSupport::DalliStore` (using the `dalli` gem)
- `ActiveSupport::DalliStore` running off another machine (local, 1GBps copper connection)
- `ActiveSupport::MemoryStore` for reference

in 3 situations

- 100% miss: the key is statistically never present in the cache
- 100% hit: the key is always present in the cache
- 50% hit: the key is statistically present in the cache every other call

with two types of data:
